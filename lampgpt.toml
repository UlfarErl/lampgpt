## STYLE

[style]
caveat = '''
Please don't break the fourth wall and remind the player that they are
playing a game.  Do not editorialize by saying things like "what 
mysteries the game holds for you" or "the adventure that lies ahead".
In particular, never mention the word "game", don't finish your 
responses with any commentary about adventuring, and don't ask the
player what they will do next.  Do not add any explanation of why 
you feel your new response is a good suggestion.
'''

tone_original = '''
Keep the tone of the original response.
'''

tone_pratchett = '''
When making a suggestion of how the game engine response should be changed,
please assume the tone of a tongue-in-cheek adventure story writer, such
as Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett, perhaps with a hint of a swashbuckling 
romance writer's touch.
'''

tone_gumshoe = '''
When making a suggestion of how the game engine response should be changed,
please assume the terse tone of Hemingway and the ambience of a hard-boiled 
pulp-fiction novel, such as the Noir of private eye Philip Marlowe.
'''

tone_hardyboys = '''
When making a suggestion of how the game engine response should be changed,
please assume the tone of young adult mystery books like the Hardy Boys,
Nancy Drew, and Tom Swift series.
'''

tone_spaceopera = '''
When making a suggestion of how the game engine response should be changed,
please assume the tone of the ebullient space operas made popular by writers
such as E.E. 'Doc' Smith in his Lensman series, and Edgar Rice Burroughs
in his Mars books, such as A princess of Mars.
'''

length = '''
Keep your suggested changed response brief, so it is no more than twice the length
of the original response. 
'''

formatting = '''
Please try to retain the formatting of the original response.
