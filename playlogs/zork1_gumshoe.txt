West of House
Here you are, a lone figure in an open field, the white house to your west 
standing silent, its door boarded up like a secret begging to be told. A small 
mailbox stands sentinel nearby.

>se
South of House
You've made your way to the house's south side, where the white facade turns 
cold and unwelcoming. No doors offer entry, no windows offer a peek inside – 
all shut tight, boarded up like the place has got something to hide.

>e
Behind House
You find yourself at the house's back, where secrets might lurk in the shadows. 
A path snakes into the dark embrace of the forest to the east. Tucked away in 
the house's embrace, a small window cracks open – a silent invitation or a 
trap, only one way to find out.

>examine the forest
The forest stretches out like a dark canvas, shadows playing tricks on your 
eyes. It's a dense thicket, each tree a silent sentinel with stories untold. 
The path into its heart is less inviting, more a challenge. If you're looking 
for secrets, maybe it's not the trees you should be examining, but where 
they're leading you. Try to "follow the path" or "enter the forest" if you dare 
to see what lies beyond.

>look west
You turn your gaze westward, eyes squinting for clues in the dim light. But the 
world's a cryptic place, and not all commands can unlock its secrets. Try to 
"go west" or "examine" something specific in your sights. The answers might not 
always be straight ahead.

>examine the window
The window hangs open like a crooked smile, a sliver of darkness peeking 
through. It's ajar, alright, teasing secrets on the other side. But don't get 
your hopes up – it's not wide enough to slip through, not without a little more 
persuasion or a different approach.

>open the window
With a grunt and a heave, you muscle the window open, wide enough now to make 
your move. It's an invitation, or maybe a challenge – either way, the path 
inside lays bare, courtesy of your determination.

>e
Clearing
You've stumbled into a clearing, a pocket of calm in the forest's embrace. The 
path here knows two faces: east and west, each holding its own secrets, 
whispering of journeys untaken. The trees stand watch, silent guardians of the 
crossroads.

>e
Canyon View
Here you stand, on the edge of the world, the Great Canyon yawning beneath you 
like the maw of some ancient beast. The view's a knockout – the canyon, the 
Frigid River snaking through it, and beyond, the White Cliffs locking arms with 
the Flathead Mountains. To the north, Aragain Falls tumbles down, a rainbow 
dancing in its mist. The dark mouth of a cavern swallows the river whole. 
Behind you, an endless sea of forest whispers secrets in the wind. A path 
carves its way northwest, and if you've got the nerve, a way down into the 
canyon's depths beckons.

>nw
Back in the Clearing
You've circled back, like a detective retracing his steps, to a familiar 
clearing. The forest path, a silent witness, stretches out, holding its secrets 
close. The trees around you, indifferent sentinels, whisper of paths taken and 
untaken.

>e
Canyon View, Once More
You find yourself back at the canyon's edge, the vast expanse stretching before 
you like a challenge from nature itself. The view remains breathtaking, a 
testament to the wild's untamed beauty. The path you tread is worn but 
determined, leading you back to this precipice of adventure.

>can I go down?
The game's ear isn't tuned to catch every word tossed its way, especially the 
polite ones. If you're itching to descend into the canyon's depths, try cutting 
to the chase with "go down" or "climb down". The path might be steep, but your 
words don't have to be.

>d
Rocky Ledge
Here you are, perched on a ledge, the canyon's heart beating below and the sky 
stretching above. The river, a silver snake, carves its path through the 
canyon, slipping through passages too narrow for your pursuit. Below, the 
canyon floor beckons, a siren's call to the adventurous. Above, the cliff face 
offers a challenge, daring you to climb. Every direction holds a story, waiting 
for the next move of a daring soul.

>d
Canyon Bottom
Now you're at the canyon's floor, under the towering walls that might just let 
a brave soul scale them. The Aragain Falls' quieter waters rush by, whispering 
of places unseen. To the north, a narrow path cuts through the wilderness, a 
thin line between the known and the mystery beyond. Here, at the bottom of the 
world, every direction is a climb, every choice a challenge.

>n
End of Rainbow
You've wandered onto a rocky stretch of beach where the Frigid River, fresh 
from its leap over the falls, continues its journey. Hemmed in by the imposing 
White Cliffs, the beach feels like a secret kept from the sky. Yet here, the 
canyon opens up, letting in a spill of sunlight that dances with the mist to 
cast a rainbow across the falls to the east. A narrow path snakes away to the 
southwest, promising more hidden corners of this wild world. Here, at the end 
of the rainbow, you half expect to find more than just the promise of gold.

>examine rainbow
The rainbow, a fleeting masterpiece of light and mist, arcs gracefully over the 
falls. It's a spectacle that defies the mundane, each hue a whisper of wonders 
beyond. While it might seem like just another part of the landscape, remember, 
in places like these, even the ordinary can hide secrets. Maybe there's nothing 
to find at its end, but the beauty of the rainbow itself is a treasure worth 
noting. If you're looking for more than just a view, consider exploring the 
areas it touches or the source of its creation.

>e
East's a no-go, pal. The landscape's got its own ideas about where you can and 
can't tread. Maybe it's the cliffs, or the river's mood, but that way's not in 
the cards. Try another direction, or take a closer look around. There's always 
another angle in this game.

>look under rainbow
Beneath the rainbow's ethereal arch, the Frigid River carves its path, 
relentless and cold. It's a scene straight out of a dream, where nature plays 
its hand, painting the air with color and the earth with the river's icy brush. 
No pots of gold here, just the raw, untamed beauty of the wild.

>get all
You cast a wide net, looking to grab whatever this place might be hiding. But 
the truth is, there's nothing here to pocket, no treasures lying around for the 
taking. This spot's clean, maybe too clean. Keep your eyes peeled and your wits 
about you. There's more to this place than meets the eye.

>examine all
Water: It's just water, but don't let its calm fool you. Every drop tells a 
story of journeys unseen, of depths unexplored.

Rainbow: More than just refracted light, it's a fleeting work of art, a bridge 
to nowhere painted across the sky with a palette only nature could hold.

River: It's not just any river. It's the lifeblood of this canyon, cutting 
through stone and time, carrying secrets in its icy embrace.

Each piece of this scene plays its part in the grand scheme, a tableau too vast 
for simple descriptions. Look closer, think deeper. There's always more than 
meets the eye.

>drink water
You lean down, cupping the water with your hands, and take a cautious sip. It's 
cold, sharper than the air around you, a reminder of the river's journey 
through the heart of the canyon. It's just water, but out here, it tastes like 
survival, like a small victory against the elements. You straighten up, feeling 
the chill slide down your throat, a brief respite in a world that offers few.

>s
South's a dead end, friend. The landscape here doesn't play by the usual rules, 
and it's got its own ideas about where you can tread. Maybe it's the cliffs, 
the river's mood, or just the way the wind's blowing. Either way, that path's 
not yours to walk. Time to plot a new course, find another angle. This world's 
full of them, if you know where to look.

>look around
End of Rainbow
Here you stand, at the world's edge, on a beach cradled by the relentless push 
of the Frigid River. The White Cliffs loom like silent giants, their shadows 
slicing the narrow strip of sand. Above, the canyon breathes open, spilling 
sunlight that dances on the water's surface. A rainbow, bold and defiant, 
arches over the falls to the east, a bridge to dreams untold. To the southwest, 
a path whispers of mysteries yet to be uncovered. This place, caught between 
the roar of the falls and the quiet of the cliffs, holds stories only the brave 
dare to uncover.

>where can I go ?
The game's ear might not catch every word, but it understands the spirit of 
your quest. If you're looking to chart your path, try asking "go where?" or 
simply "look" to get a lay of the land. The world around you is vast, filled 
with hidden nooks and crannies waiting to be discovered. Paths may lead to the 
unknown, and choices you make could open doors you never knew existed. Keep 
your eyes open, adventurer. The next step is yours to take.

Back at Canyon Bottom
You've circled back, like a gumshoe tailing a lead that's gone cold, to the 
canyon's floor. The walls here could tell stories, if only they could talk. The 
river's murmur is your only companion, a constant in this ever-changing maze. 
Paths may lead you astray or towards your fortune. Keep your wits about you; 
this isn't a place for the faint-hearted.

>get some sand
You scoop up a handful of sand, its grains slipping through your fingers like 
fleeting thoughts. For a moment, you ponder the stories each grain could tell, 
the journeys they've made to end up here, beneath your feet. But this isn't a 
treasure you can pocket or a clue that will lead you to the end of your quest. 
It's just sand, a piece of this vast, mysterious world. You let it fall, 
watching it blend back into the landscape, and turn your attention back to the 
adventure at hand.

>wave your arms and curse the sky !
You throw your arms up and unleash a torrent of curses at the indifferent sky, 
a momentary release of frustration in a world that often gives no quarter. The 
sky, vast and unyielding, holds its silence, a stoic witness to the trials of 
those who dare to challenge the mysteries below. Your words dissipate into the 
air, leaving no mark on the heavens or your predicament. It's clear: if answers 
or solace you seek, they won't be found in the empty embrace of the sky. Better 
to gather your wits and continue on; this adventure cares not for curses, only 
actions.
