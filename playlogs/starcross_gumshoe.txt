Release 18 / Serial number 830114  You're out cold in the bunk of your beat-up
black hole hunter, the "Starcross," floating in the void off Ceres. Just as you
hit the sweet spot of sleep, a shrill alarm slices through the silence! It's the
mass detector! You snap to attention. Your luck's been dirt so far, and your
pockets are as empty as the space around you. This could be the big score you've
been sweating for.  Living Quarters (You're sprawled in the bunk.) This cramped
hole is what you call home, with nothing but a bunk and a bureau to its name.
The only way out is starboard. A tape library's stashed here. (outside the bunk)

>leave bunk
You haul yourself out of the bunk, not a moment too soon. The alarm bell from
the mass detector cuts through the silence like a knife. Trouble's calling, and
it's time to answer.

>stand up
You rise, feet hitting the cold deck with a thud that echoes in the cramped
quarters. The alarm bell from the mass detector is a relentless siren, a
harbinger of either fortune or doom.

>search bunk
Rummaging through the bunk turns up the same old nothing - just the ghosts of
dreams past. Meanwhile, the alarm bell from the mass detector cuts through the
silence, relentless, like a siren call to the unknown.

>go starboard
Bridge You step into the nerve center of the Starcross, where decisions weigh
heavy and the unknown looms large. Exits whisper of escape: "Port," "Starboard,"
and the foreboding "Out" behind a sealed bulkhead.  The ship's computer hums, a
faithful companion in the cold void, handling the mundane tasks of keeping you
alive. A control couch, your throne among the stars, faces a panel littered with
controls and a viewport that stares into the abyss. The ship's ID clings to the
wall, a reminder of distant bureaucracies.  Off to the side, the mass detector,
your key to fortune, is alive with urgency. Red and blue buttons beg for
attention beside a screen that might just spell your future. A faded instruction
sheet for the computer flutters on the wall, a testament to simpler times.  The
alarm bell from the mass detector cuts through the silence, a clarion call to
action.

>press red button
With a steady press of the red button, the alarm's shrill cry cuts off mid-howl,
plunging the bridge back into a tense silence.

>read id
The ship's registration, a relic from a time when you had to answer to someone
else's call, clings to the wall. It reads: "Starcross, Mining Vessel, Ceres
Outpost #7." A reminder of where you've been and just how far you've ventured
into the void.

>sit in couch
You ease into the control couch, the command seat of your solitary kingdom among
the stars. The seat belt dangles at your side, a silent reminder of the dangers
that lurk in the void.

>wear seat belt
With a decisive pull, you secure the seat belt around you. Click - it's the
sound of readiness, a pact between you and the void that you're not going down
without a fight.

>examine panel
The control panel before you is a relic of necessity, built for the lone miner
against the cosmos. It's a jungle of switches and dials, most lying dormant,
waiting for a crisis. The Starcross prefers the sound of your voice to commands,
but these controls stand ready for when words fail and action speaks.

>read screen
The screen's glow cuts through the dim, spelling out "mass UM28" in stark
letters. It's a cold, cryptic message from the void, a whisper of something out
there, waiting in the dark.

>press blue button
With a deliberate press of the blue button, the mass detector springs to life,
its screen flickering with new data. It's like the machine itself is holding its
breath, waiting to reveal secrets hidden in the cosmic dark.

>examine screen
Leaning closer, you see the screen spell out "mass UM28" in cold, digital
script. It's a beacon in the void, a signpost pointing to something out there in
the dark. Could be nothing. Could be the jackpot. Either way, it's a lead in
this vast, silent sea of stars.

>examine output
The output lays bare the bones of the cosmos right in front of you, detailing
major mass concentrations like secrets whispered in the dark. Each one tagged
with a code, a set of coordinates in R, Theta, and Phi, like the universe
plotting points on a map only you can read. It's a roadmap to the unknown, each
destination a roll of the dice in this cosmic game of chance.

>read coordinates of mass um28
You lean in, scrutinizing the screen for the secrets of UM28. The display
obliges, revealing its coordinates: R=3.14, Theta=45°, Phi=90°. It's a set of
numbers, cold and impersonal, but to you, they're a siren's song, pulling you
towards the unknown.
